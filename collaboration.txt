Devin Barron: Created the bulk of the (albeit inefficient) code.  This was slowly cleaned up/added to by other members (for example, the addition of the divider to separate activation records, as well as changing long strands of if-else statements to more efficient switch statements).
Jonathan Brownlee: Added code that prints the divider between bp and the rest of the stack. Helped with debugging.
Christian Acosta: Assisted with testing of completed code to ensure proper operation of program.
